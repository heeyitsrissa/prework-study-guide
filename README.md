# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide made for students in the coding bootcamp. This study guide serves as an easy access space to refresh the mind of all things learned during the prework and can be revisted when needed to review what was learned. During the process of building this application not only did I learn about HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript but I was able to use them to create this study guide.
